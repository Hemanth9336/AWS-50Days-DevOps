## 💡 What I Learned Today

### What is a Subnet

A subnet is a smaller network inside a VPC that helps organize and isolate resources.

### Role of VPC and Subnets

VPC provides the network, and subnets divide it into smaller sections for better management and security.

### Availability Zones

Subnets are tied to a specific Availability Zone, which helps in high availability and fault tolerance.
